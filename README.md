This repository contains the documents for a technical specification published by the [Knowledge on Web Scale](https://knows.idlab.ugent.be/) (KNoWS) group of the [Internet Technology and Data Science Lab](https://idlab.ugent.be/) (IDLab), an [imec](https://www.imec-int.com/)-affiliated research group at [Ghent University](https://ugent.be/) (UGent).

It is a working draft, that has NOT been publically reviewed, but represents active research at its time of publication. As such, documents may be subject to changes, and other documents may supersede them at any time. 

---

The specification is being drafted in multiple stages. 

- **Level 0** describes the interfaces and protocols of the final prototype implementation presented in our white paper.[^1] It lays the groundwork for the general flow of the protocol.
- **Level 1** builds on Level 0, addressing some minor shortcomings discussed in the white paper, and optimising alignment with existing standards.
- **Level 2** and higher will build on Level 1, to cover the more extensive questions left open in the white paper.

Comments regarding this specification are welcome, using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/authz-spec/issues/), but the editors do NOT guarantee that this feedback will be processed, or when.
